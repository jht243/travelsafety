## Privacy & Data Use

- **What we collect:** When the widget runs inside ChatGPT we receive the location (city/region/country), locale, device/browser fingerprint, and trip query details via `_meta`.
- **How we use it:** These fields feed the `/analytics` dashboard only; we do not sell or share this data.
- **Retention:** Logs are stored for **30 days** in the `/logs` folder and then automatically rotated.
- **User input storage:** The widget caches your checklist progress in `localStorage`; entries expire after **30 days**. Clear anytime with the "Reset" button.
